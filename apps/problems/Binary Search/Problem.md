## Binary Search

Given a sorted array arr and an integer k, find the 
position(0-based indexing) at which k is present in 
the array using binary search.

Note: If multiple occurrences are there, please return the smallest index.

#### Examples :
```
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: 4 appears at index 3.

```
```
Input: arr[] = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55], k = 445
Output: -1
Explanation: 445 is not present.

```
```
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 2], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 1 appears at index 0.
```
### Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5
1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6
1 <= k <= 10^6

### Company Tag:

```
Infosys Oracle Wipro Linkedin Qualcomm
