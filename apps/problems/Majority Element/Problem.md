## Majority Element

Given an array arr. Find the majority element in the array. 
If no majority exists, return -1.

A majority element in an array is an element that 
appears strictly more than arr.size()/2 times in the array.

#### Examples :
```
Input: arr[] = [3, 1, 3, 3, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Since, 3 is present more than n/2 times, 
so it is the majority element.

```
```
Input: arr[] = [7]
Output: 7
Explanation: Since, 7 is single element and present more than n/2 
times, so it is the majority element.
```
```
Input: arr[] = [2, 13]
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, no element is present more than n/2 times, so there is no majority element.
```
### Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ arr[i]≤ 10^5
