## Palindrome String

You are given a string s. Your task is to determine 
if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered 
a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

#### Examples :
```
Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

```
```
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.

```
```
Input: s = "a"
Output: true
Explanation: A single-character string is always a palindrome.
```
### Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 10^6
The string s contains only lowercase letters (a-z).
